# CloCare Patients Data Analytics

## About CloCare and the project:
This is part of the project for CloCare organization. Clocare organization aims at digitalizing health care systems using IOT solutions.
A significant part of Clocare's work is electronic health record (EHR) where patients and medical stuff's data is collected through a mobile app and a website to be stored into the health system's database. After the data is collected, it undergoes a full autonmated analysis process to get the best out of it in terms of decisions and recommendations. 

### About the data:
Althogh the data will be gathered using a mobile app when the project is in production, we got a real full patients' dataset from data.world website. The dataset had  about 76 features.
After modifying the dataset to suit our project, it included 67 features, which can be categorized as follows:
  * Patients personal data like age, height,, sex, education, marital status, wieght, waist size, etc.
  * Common diseases like diabetes, blood presure, cancer, asthma, and many more.
  * Tests results to show the efficiency of the body and the organs during different biological functions and common concentrations in blood. Some of the are CBC, BMP, CMP, Lipid panel, Cardiac biomarkers, and many more.

## The Analysis Process:
The analysis was carried in 4 dicrections to help the medical data-analyst to understand the data and gain as many insights as possible which helps him to raise recommendations to who is responsible.
The four dicrections are:
  * The analysis of the patients data alone to undersrand the patients.
  * The analysis of the diseases to know the disributions of the different diseases among the patients and their percentages.
  * The analysis of the patients data with the diseases to understand the relations between the features.
  * The analysis of the medical tests data and how they are related to the diseases and the patients attributes.

Finally, the full analysis process is automated through a script.
